Not actually Reeses brand or endorsed, just what the recipe said when
Mom sent it to me.

\ingredients
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1 cup salted butter (melted)
    \item 2 cups graham cracker crumbs. (\textit{1 package of crackers $\approx$ 1 cup crushed. Use food processor to chop and grind to fine powder})
    \item \nicefrac{1}{4} cup brown sugar
    \item 1 \nicefrac{3}{4} cup powdered sugar
    \item 1 cup peanut butter
    \item \nicefrac{1}{2} teaspoon vanilla
    \item 1 (11 oz) bag chocolate chips (\textit{orginally calls for milk chocolate, I've found I like the semi-sweet or bittersweet, as there is enough sugar elsewhere.})
\end{itemize}

\instructions
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Combine all ingredients, except chocolate chips, in a medium sized bowl. Stir until mixture is smooth and creamy.
    \item Place parchment paper in pan if desired. Pour peanut butter mixture into 9" $\times$ 13" pan. (\textit{Or smaller. I like it with a bit more thickness}). May require pressing and spreading into pan by hand. 
    \item Melt chocolate chips in microwave (at half power) for 1-2 minutes. (\textit{Stir occasionally to prevent some of chocolate burning. Or use a double boiler or some other method for melting.}) Pour accross peanut butter mixture and spread with spatula. Tap pan on counter to even out chocolate.
    \item Refrigerate for an hour. Cut while bars are still cool.
\end{enumerate}
