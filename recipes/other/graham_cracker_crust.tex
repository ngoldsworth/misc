\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{No-Bake Recipesk}: If the crust and pie will not be baked,
    prepare the pie crust as directed, then place the pan in the freezer for at
    least 15 minutes before filling it.
    \item \textbf{Baked Recipes}: If the graham cracker crust needs to be
    pre-baked, bake at 350 degrees Farenheit for 10 minutes, then proceed with your
    recipe as written.
\end{itemize}


\textit{Make Ahead and Freezing Instructions}

\notes
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Equipment}: This recipe works for a standard 9-inch pie plate,
    8-inch or 9-inch square pan, or a 9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. You will
    need to double the recipe to use in a 9Ã—13-inch pan.

    \item \textbf{Graham Crackers}: You can use any flavor or variety of graham
    cracker you like (and you can buy a box of graham cracker crumbs!), or you
    can also use crushed digestive biscuits, gingersnaps, vanilla wafers, or
    cornflakes. Whichever of these you use, just be sure to crush as finely as
    possible and measure out 2 cups of crumbs.

    \item \textbf{Brown Sugar}: You can substitute regular granulated sugar,
    coconut sugar, or muscovado.

    \item \textbf{Butter}: You can substitute vegan alternatives or coconut oil.
    For an extra oomph of flavor, go the extra step of making browned butter
    instead of simply melting the butter.
