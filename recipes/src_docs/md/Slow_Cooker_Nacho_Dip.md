**Slow-Cooker Chicken Enchilada Dip**

2 cups chopped fresh tomatoes (about 2 medium)

1 cup chopped onion

2 cloves garlic

1 fresh jalapeño pepper, stemmed

1 tablespoon chili powder

1 teaspoon ground cumin

3/4 teaspoon salt

1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast

8 ounces reduced-fat cream cheese

1 15-ounce can black beans, rinsed

1 cup corn, fresh or frozen (thawed)

1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

2 tablespoons sliced scallions

2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

Combine tomatoes, onion, garlic, jalapeño, chili powder, cumin and salt
in a blender. Puree until smooth.

Pour the sauce into a 5- to 6-quart slow cooker. Nestle chicken into the
sauce. Cover and cook on High for 3 hours or on Low for 6 hours.

Remove the chicken and shred using two forks. Stir the chicken back into
the sauce in the slow cooker. Add cream cheese, beans, corn and Cheddar.
Stir to combine. Cover and cook on High until the cheese is melted and
the sauce is hot, 10 to 15 minutes.

Serve the dip topped with scallions and cilantro.

Cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day.
