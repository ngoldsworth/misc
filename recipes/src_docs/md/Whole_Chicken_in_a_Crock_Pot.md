**Overnight Chicken Stock in the Crock Pot**

 

[Leftover chicken
bones](http://www.100daysofrealfood.com/2011/02/25/recipe-the-best-whole-chicken-in-a-crock-pot/) or
carcass roughly equivalent to one small or medium sized chicken

-   1 onion, peeled and loosely chopped

-   1 rib of celery, roughly chopped

-   1 carrot, roughly chopped (no need to peel)

-   1 bay leaf

-   1 sprig fresh parsley

-   1 sprig fresh thyme

-   Salt, to taste \
    Note: If you are missing any of these ingredients I wouldn\'t let
    that stop you from making it anyway.

INSTRUCTIONS

1.  After removing all edible meat from the chicken put/leave the bones,
    skin, cooking juices, etc. in the crock pot. If you are using the
    chicken carcass from the "The Best Whole Chicken in the Crock Pot"
    recipe just leave every single thing that\'s leftover (except the
    good meat of course) in the crock pot including the original onion
    and spices you used when making the chicken.

2.  Add the onion, celery, carrot and spices on top of the bones and
    fill the crock pot almost to the top with tap water (leaving about
    ½" at the top).

3.  Turn the slow cooker onto \"low\" after dinner and cook all night
    long or alternatively you could start it in the morning and cook on
    \"low\" for 8 -- 10 hours during the day.

4.  After the stock is done cooking turn off the heat and, using a soup
    ladle, pass the stock through a fine sieve to remove all
    herbs/bones/etc.

5.  Either refrigerate or freeze the stock for future use. I usually
    freeze some in both 1 and 2-cup portions, and I also sometimes
    freeze stock in ice cube trays just in case I just "need a little"
    for making sauce or rice. This stock is great
    in [soups](http://www.100daysofrealfood.com/real-food-resources/#salad)like [chicken
    noodle
    soup](http://www.100daysofrealfood.com/2011/10/05/recipe-homemade-chicken-noodle-soup/) and
    also in rice
    like [risotto](http://www.100daysofrealfood.com/2011/12/23/recipe-brown-rice-risotto/). \
    Enjoy!
