# Finance stuff

Various scripts I've written to do finance related math for me. 

NOTE: `loan.py` and `loans.py` are two very different modules.
`loan.py` is me working on building an object-oriented approach to working with loans over the entire life of the loan.
`loans.py` (plural) is a few functions that I use in several other scripts.

All of the math for these files I got from Wikipedia. Of particular use is the page on [Amortization calculators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortization_calculator) and the page on [APR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_percentage_rate)s.
