\subsection*{Digital Systems -- Staement of Interest}

Since graduating from \textsc{msu}, I have been employed at Bridger Photonics, mostly working on embedded computers that live in complex optical systems.
I have found that I \textit{really} enjoy what is usually described as computer engineering and computer science. I also enjoy applying these things to optics and photonics. 
While my undergraduate background in physics has improved incredibly useful, I plan now for a career that focuses on the intersection of physics, optics, computer engineering, and computer science.
