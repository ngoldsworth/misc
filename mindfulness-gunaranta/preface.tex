\chapter{Preface}
In my experience I found that the most effective way to express something in
order to make others understand is to use the simplest language. Also I learned
from teaching that the more rigid the language the less effective it is. People
do not respond to very stern and rigid language especially when we try to teach
something which normally people don't engage in during their daily life.
Meditation appears to them as something that they cannot always do. As more
people turn to meditation, they need more simplified instructions so they can
practice by themselves without a teacher around. This book is the result of
requests made by many meditators who need a very simple book written in ordinary
colloquial language.

In preparing this book I have been helped by many of my friends. I am deeply
grateful to all of them. Especially I would like to express my deepest
appreciation and sincere gratitude to John Patticord, Daniel J. Olmsted, Matthew
Flickstein, Carol Flickstein, Patrick Hamilton, Genny Hamilton, Bill Mayne,
Bhikkhu Dang Pham Jotika and Bhikkhu Sona for their most valuable suggestions,
comments and criticisms of numerous points in preparing this book. Also thanks
to Reverend Sister Sama and Chris O'Keefe for their support in production
efforts.
